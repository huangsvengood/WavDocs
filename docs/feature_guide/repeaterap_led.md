!!! info "Precautions"

	- In certain situations (such as bedrooms or children's rooms), turning off or limiting the router lights can effectively reduce light pollution and help improve sleep quality.
	- For users who need to monitor the status of the device 24 hours a day, it is recommended to keep the default light display mode to ensure that the status of the device is known at any time.
