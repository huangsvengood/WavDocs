DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name System) is a function that maps a dynamic IP address to a fixed domain name. When DDNS is enabled, the router will bind your dynamic WAN IP with a fixed domain name, making it easier for you to connect the device remotely. To use this service, you need to sign up for DDNS Service.

Choose a dynamic DNS service provider (oray.com/NO-IP)
</p>
- Service Provider : Dynamic DNS service provider, filled in here is oray.com/NO-IP.

- Username : The username of the oray.com/NO-IP account, used to verify identity and permissions.

- Password : The password of the oray.com/NO-IP account, used to verify identity and permissions.

- Host Name : If you want to bind your router to a dynamic DNS address, you can set a hostname here, such as "myrouter.oray.net". When your router's IP address changes, the dynamic DNS service will automatically update the IP address of that hostname so that you can always access your router through that hostname.

Please note that different dynamic DNS service providers may have different parameter settings, and the specific parameter names and meanings may be different. It is recommended to carefully review relevant documents and instructions before configuration to ensure that relevant parameters are filled in correctly.
