	- Back up the router configuration files regularly. It is recommended to perform backup operations once a month or quarterly.
	- When restoring the router configuration file, be sure to select the correct backup file and carefully review the configuration information to ensure that the router can operate normally after restoration.
	- Keep the backup file properly and avoid recording it directly next to the router or in a place where it can be easily accessed by others.
