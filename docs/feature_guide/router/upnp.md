<p class="text">
UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is a networking protocol designed to make connections between devices simpler and more automated. 
</p>
<p class="text">
By using the UPnP protocol, devices can automatically discover each other on the network and establish communication connections without requiring manual configuration or setup. 
</p>
<p class="text">
UPnP also allows devices to share resources such as files, printers, and other multimedia content. The UPnP protocol is widely used in home networks and office environments to facilitate communication and interaction between devices.
