	<b>DNS Protocol</b> : This refers to the communication protocol used for DNS queries and responses.

	 __DNS over HTTPS__ (DNS is based on Hypertext Transfer Security Protocol) : DNS over HTTPS uses the HTTPS protocol to encrypt DNS communications. It encapsulates DNS queries and responses in HTTPS requests and responses, providing higher privacy and security, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.

	 __DNS over TLS__ (DNS based on Transport Layer Security Protocol) : DNS over TLS uses the TLS protocol for encrypted transmission of DNS queries and responses. This provides greater privacy and security, preventing DNS queries from being eavesdropped or tampered with.

<p class="text">
Manually specify the DNS server to be used for domain name resolution. You can choose to use a public DNS server such as OpenDNS, or use a specific third-party DNS server.
