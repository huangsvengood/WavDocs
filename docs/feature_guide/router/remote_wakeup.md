## __Parameter Description__
- __MAC Address__ : A MAC address is a unique identifier for every network device. In remote wake-up, you need to know the MAC address of the computer you want to wake up in order to send a wake-up signal to it.

- __Time Setting__ : This is the time you want the remote wake to be performed. You can set a specific time, such as "23:30", to specify that the computer wakes up at a specific time. If you don't specify a time, the computer will wake up immediately.

- __Reboot Time__ : If you want to remotely wake up your computer at the same time every day, you can set a repeat option. Select "Every day" or specify certain days of the week to have the computer automatically wake up at each specified time.
