Signal adjustment refers to the process of adjusting signal strength to improve the performance and coverage of wireless networks. There are three common signal adjustment modes based on different needs and environments: __low, middle, and high__. 

Here are the differences between them :

Low signal adjustment mode (Low):
!!! note ""
	- The signal strength is low and suitable for small-range wireless networks.
	- Bandwidth and speed may be limited, but provide a stable connection.
	- Suitable for use in areas with low population density or a small number of devices.

Medium signal adjustment mode (Middle):
!!! note ""
	- The signal strength is moderate and suitable for general wireless network needs.
	- Provides high bandwidth and speed to meet the needs of multiple users connecting at the same time.
	- Use in moderately populated areas or when better coverage is needed.

High signal adjustment mode (High):
!!! note ""
	- The signal strength is high and suitable for a wide range of wireless network needs. 
	- Provides maximum bandwidth and speed to support a large number of simultaneous user connections and high-load data transmission. 
	- Ideal for use in areas with high population density or where wide coverage is required, such as large enterprises, campuses or public places.

It should be noted that the choice of signal adjustment mode should be based on actual needs and network environment to balance performance, coverage and user experience. In the settings, you can select the signal adjustment mode that suits your network needs based on the specific situation.
