## __PPTP Passthrough__ 
- PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) is a protocol used to establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection. Enabling the PPTP Passthrough feature allows PPTP traffic to be forwarded through the network device's NAT so that the PPTP VPN connection is properly established and transmitted.
## __L2TP Passthrough__
- L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) is also a commonly used VPN protocol. Enabling the L2TP Passthrough feature allows L2TP traffic to be forwarded through the network device's NAT so that the L2TP VPN connection is properly established and transmitted.
## __IPSec Passthrough__
- IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) is a commonly used network security protocol used to encrypt and verify IP data packets. Enabling the IPSec Passthrough feature allows IPSec traffic to be forwarded through the network device's NAT so that the IPSec VPN connection is properly established and transmitted.
## __FTP ALG__
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for file transfer, and ALG refers to application layer gateway. Enabling the FTP ALG function can help process and forward FTP traffic on network devices.
## __TFTP ALG__
- TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is a simplified file transfer protocol. The TFTP ALG function can help process and forward TFTP traffic on network devices.
## __RTSP ALG__
- RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) is a protocol used for streaming media transmission. The RTSP ALG function can help process and forward RTSP traffic on network devices.
## __H323 ALG__
- H323 is a set of protocols used to implement audio, video and data communications. The H323 ALG function can help process and forward H323 traffic on network devices.
## __SIP ALG__
- SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is a protocol for establishing and terminating sessions, mainly used for VoIP telephony and multimedia communications. The SIP ALG function can help process and forward SIP traffic on network devices.
