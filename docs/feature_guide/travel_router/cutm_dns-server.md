	<b>DNS Protocol</b> : This refers to the communication protocol used for DNS queries and responses.

	 __DNS over HTTPS__ (DNS is based on Hypertext Transfer Security Protocol) : DNS over HTTPS uses the HTTPS protocol to encrypt DNS communications. It encapsulates DNS queries and responses in HTTPS requests and responses, providing higher privacy and security, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.

	 __DNS over TLS__ (DNS based on Transport Layer Security Protocol) : DNS over TLS uses the TLS protocol for encrypted transmission of DNS queries and responses. This provides greater privacy and security, preventing DNS queries from being eavesdropped or tampered with.

Manually specify the DNS server to be used for domain name resolution. You can choose to use a public DNS server such as OpenDNS, or use a specific third-party DNS server.
