## __IPTV__
<p class="text">
By setting up IPTV, you can enjoy multimedia services on your IPTV TV while using the internet. You need to consult your IPTV service provider about selecting the IPTV mode and inputting the VLAN ID. Then you can set the corresponding LAN interface and connect the cable from your IPTV device to the corresponding LAN port on your router.

- IPTV Mode : This option is used to specify the working mode of IPTV, including vlan Bridge mode and Routing mode. In Bridge mode, IPTV signals will be transmitted directly through the network bridge; in Routing mode, IPTV signals will be processed by the router before being transmitted.

- VLAN Bridge Mode : This option specifies the VLAN bridge mode. VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a technology that logically divides LAN members. Bridge mode means that VLANs can communicate with each other.
