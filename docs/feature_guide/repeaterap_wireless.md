!!! info "Wi-Fi encryption methods"	
	__WPA/WPA2-Enterprise__: This is a more secure method of WiFi encryption suitable for enterprise environments. It uses an authentication protocol called 802.1X that requires users to provide personal identification credentials (such as username and password) in order to facilitate the connection. This encryption method also supports the use of remote authentication servers for user authentication. This type of encryption is commonly used on corporate networks to ensure that only authorized users can access the network.
